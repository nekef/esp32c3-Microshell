# ESP32c3-Microshell

**ESP32c3-Microshell** is an open source mini operating system for the ESP32-C3 platform, powered by MicroPython. Inspired by traditional Unix shells like `bash`, it provides a familiar environment for file management and scripting on embedded devices.

## Features

- Interactive shell interface
- File operations: create, read, write, delete
- Directory navigation: `ls`, `pwd`, etc.
- Minimal script execution and automation
- Lightweight and designed for microcontrollers
- Built-in commands similar to POSIX shells
- **Automatic startup:** The shell runs automatically upon boot—just connect and start using!

## Development Environment

- Built for the ESP32-C3 microcontroller.
- Developed with [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/) (Espressif IoT Development Framework).
- Works with [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/download/esp32c3/).
- Easy flashing and file management using [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) (recommended for beginners).
